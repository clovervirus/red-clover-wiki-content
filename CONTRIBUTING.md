# Contributing to Red Clover Wiki Content

Thank you for your interest in improving the Red Clover Wiki! The guidelines below help
us keep contributions consistent and easy to review. Please read this document before
opening an issue or submitting a change.

## Getting Started

- **Clone the repository** and create a dedicated branch for your work (see Branch
  Strategy below).
- **Install prerequisites** as described in the project README if you plan to run or
  preview the site locally.
- **Open an issue** to propose significant changes or discuss enhancements before you
  start. For minor fixes (typos, formatting), issues are optional but appreciated.

## Branch Strategy

- Create feature branches from the latest `main` branch using a descriptive name, e.g.
  `feature/update-article-title` or `fix/broken-link`.
- Keep branches focused on a single topic to make reviews simple and targeted.
- Rebase on top of `main` when possible to keep history clean and avoid merge
  conflicts.

## Making Changes

- Follow any style or content guidance documented in the repository (including
  templates within `_templates/`).
- Include relevant front matter and metadata when adding or updating content files.
- Provide clear commit messages that describe the change and reference any related
  issues.

## Testing and Validation

- Preview your content locally (e.g., via `yarn dev` for Wiki.js) to ensure formatting,
  links, and assets render correctly.
- Run any automated checks or linters documented in the README prior to submission.

## Pull Requests

- Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.
- Summarize the motivation and key updates in the PR description.
- Request a review from a project maintainer. Expect to incorporate feedback or make
  adjustments until the change is approved.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. Please avoid merging your own PRs
  unless you have been granted that permission.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and collaborative in all interactions. Report any issues to the
maintainers so we can address them promptly.

We appreciate your contributions and for helping keep the Red Clover Wiki accurate and
up to date!
