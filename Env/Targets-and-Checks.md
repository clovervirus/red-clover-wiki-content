# Environment Targets and Checks

## Core Setpoints by Stage

| Stage | Temp °F (lights on/off) | RH % | VPD kPa | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------|------|---------|-------|
| Propagation | 78 / 75 | 75 | 0.7 | Dome vents cracked, minimal airflow. |
| Veg | 80 / 74 | 65 | 1.0 | Maintain strong oscillation and CO₂ at 900 ppm. |
| Early Flower | 78 / 72 | 60 | 1.2 | Increase dehumidification capacity before stretch. |
| Late Flower | 74 / 68 | 50 | 1.3 | Keep leaf surface temps in check; avoid condensation. |

## Daily Checks

- Review the environment dashboard for every room; confirm temps, RH, and CO₂ are within ±2 of target values.
- Inspect humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and mini-split filters; empty and clean catch trays if biofilm is present.
- Verify fans and louvers are operating; feel canopy level airflow and adjust oscillation angles as needed.
- Compare overnight trend charts to catch slow drifts or equipment faults; log findings in the environment notebook.
- Reset data loggers at lights on and archive charts weekly to the shared drive.
