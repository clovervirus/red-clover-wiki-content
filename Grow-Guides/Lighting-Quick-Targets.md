# Lighting Quick Targets

> PPFD measured at canopy center; DLI assumes 18h (veg) / 12h (flower) schedules.

| Stage            | PPFD (µmol/m²/s) | DLI (mol/m²/day) | Notes                        |
|------------------|------------------:|-----------------:|-------------------------------|
| Seedling/Clone   | 150–300           | 10–15            | High blue ratio helps stacking |
| Vegetative       | 300–600           | 20–39            | Keep even spread; manage heat  |
| Early Flower     | 600–800           | 26–35 (12h)      | Watch stretch and leaf temp    |
| Mid/Late Flower  | 800–1000          | 35–43 (12h)      | Only if CO₂ and env allow      |

**Tips**

- Verify with a PAR map when possible; avoid hotspots >1100 PPFD unless leaf temps are controlled.
- If leaves taco or bleach, lower intensity or raise fixtures, and re-check VPD.
