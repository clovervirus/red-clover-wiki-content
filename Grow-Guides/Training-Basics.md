- Structural start: Top or FIM above the 5th node once plants recover from transplant (usually Veg Week 2); confirm vigor aligns with the checklist in [[Grow-Guides/Veg]].
- LST anchors: Install soft ties and pull outer branches 2–3" below the main to open the canopy; combine with the VPD targets in [[Grow-Guides/VPD-Quick-Chart]] to avoid stress.
- Defoliation cadence: Remove large fan leaves blocking bud sites every 10–14 days; log before/after photos in [[Grow-Journals]].
- Pre-flip cleanup: Three days before switching to flower lighting, lollipop the bottom 20% of growth and remove weak laterals; coordinate timing with the scene change in [[Grow-Guides/Lighting-Quick-Targets]].
- Early flower support: Install trellis netting at Flower Week 1 and tuck branches daily through Week 3; follow the structure checkpoints listed in [[Grow-Guides/Flower]].
- Recovery monitoring: Watch for slowed transpiration or droop; if present, back off training pressure and verify irrigation spacing against [[Grow-Guides/Watering-Cues]].
