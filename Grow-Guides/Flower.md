# Flower Stage Checklist

## Early Flower (Weeks 1-3)

- Lock in stretch control with aggressive airflow and tight plant spacing adjustments.
- Install trellis layers and plant yoyos before buds stack; document anchor points.
- Adjust feed schedule when runoff deviates from targets; track EC trends daily.
- Defoliate inner canopy to improve airflow while leaving solar leaves intact.

## Mid to Late Flower (Weeks 4-8)

- Track trichome development and harvest window using macro photos weekly.
- Reduce nitrogen inputs and increase potassium per the Crop Salt bloom chart.
- Maintain airflow and IPM scouting every 2â€“3 days; alternate fungicidal preventatives if pressure rises.
- Inspect dehumidifier coils and drain lines twice per week to prevent botrytis.
- Begin ripening checks two weeks out: confirm fade, drain media thoroughly, and schedule flush if required.
