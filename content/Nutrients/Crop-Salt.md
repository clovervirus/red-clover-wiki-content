# Crop Salt Feeding Notes

## Stock Solution Mixing Order

1. Fill the mix tank halfway with RO water and start circulation.

1. Add Part A and stir until fully dissolved before adding any other inputs.

1. Add Part B slowly while mixing; confirm solution stays clear.

1. Introduce additives (CalMag, micros) last, verifying compatibility chart before dosing.

1. Top to final volume with RO water and record EC, pH, and mix date on the tote label.

## Feed Chart (Per Gallon of Stock)

| Stage | Crop Salt A (g) | Crop Salt B (g) | CalMag (ml) | Target EC |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Propagation | 1.5 | 1.0 | 2 | 1.2 |
| Veg | 2.5 | 2.0 | 3 | 1.8 |
| Early Flower | 3.0 | 2.5 | 2 | 2.1 |
| Late Flower | 2.0 | 3.0 | 0 | 2.3 |
| Ripen/Flush | 0.5 | 1.0 | 0 | 1.0 |

## Usage Notes

- Maintain stock solution labels with mix date and EC; discard after 14 days or if precipitation occurs.

- Always dilute concentrates into running water to avoid localized hot spots in the reservoir.

- Log runoff EC, pH, and plant responses in the grow journal; adjust Â±0.2 EC at a time.

- For foliar applications, mix at one-quarter strength and spray at lights off with full PPE.
