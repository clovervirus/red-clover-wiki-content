# RAW NPK Additives

## Additive Order

1. Pre-dissolve each powder in warm RO water (1 cup) before adding to the reservoir.

1. Add Calcium/Magnesium supplements first, followed by Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium powders.

1. Introduce micronutrient blends last while the reservoir is agitating to prevent precipitation.

1. Allow the solution to mix for five minutes before testing EC and pH.

## Dosing Reference (Per Gallon)

| Additive | Veg Rate (g) | Bloom Rate (g) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| RAW Grow (N) | 0.75 | — | Use during weeks 1-4 veg only. |
| RAW Bloom (P) | — | 0.80 | Start at first pistils, taper final two weeks. |
| RAW K (K) | 0.25 | 0.60 | Increase if runoff K drops below 200 ppm. |
| RAW Cal/Mag | 0.50 | 0.35 | Maintain if using RO or coco substrates. |
| RAW Silica | 0.20 | 0.20 | Always add to clean water prior to other salts. |

## Usage Notes

- Dissolve completely before adding to the main reservoir to avoid undissolved grit clogging emitters.

- Avoid mixing incompatible powders in concentrated form; never combine Silica with Cal/Mag before dilution.

- Document additive doses in the feed log alongside Crop Salt EC adjustments.

- Reduce rates by 25% when stacking multiple RAW products in the same feeding.
