## Weekly Rotation
- **Monday:** Swap the two lowest-output fixtures with spares stored in [[Inventory/Bench-Scale|Equipment Cage]].
- **Wednesday:** Rotate fixtures between aisles 2 and 5 to distribute lamp age hours.
- **Friday:** Run the auto-dimming script from the BMS; confirm PPFD matches the targets in [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]].

## PPFD Targets at 18" Above Canopy
| Stage | Target PPFD (µmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹) |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| Propagation | 250 |
| Veg Early | 350 |
| Veg Late | 500 |
| Flower Weeks 1–3 | 750 |
| Flower Weeks 4–6 | 850 |
| Flower Weeks 7–8 | 900 |
| Flush | 700 |

## Maintenance
- Wipe lens covers every second Friday with 70% IPA and lint-free cloths.
- Log driver faults in [[Data/Crop-Log]] and tag maintenance in the work order system.
- Use [[Calculators/Lighting]] to translate PPFD adjustments into dimming percentages before making changes.
