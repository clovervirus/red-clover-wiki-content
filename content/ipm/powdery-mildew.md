# Powdery Mildew (PM)

**Symptoms**  
- White powder on leaves, stems, or buds.  
- Worsens in stagnant air or high humidity.

**Quick Checks**  
1. Confirm spots wipe off with finger swipe.  
2. Check environment logs for RH spikes.  
3. Inspect nearby plants for spread.

**Fix Flow**  
- Remove worst-infected leaves carefully.  
- Apply stage-safe fungicide (H₂O₂, potassium bicarbonate).  
- Increase airflow and lower RH into target range.

**When to Stop**  
- Continue until new growth stays clean for __ days.  
- Escalate to harvest/replace if buds are colonized.
