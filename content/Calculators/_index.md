Use these calculators alongside the SOPs to keep data consistent across shifts.

- [[Calculators/Dosing]] — convert between stock solution concentrations, EC, and ppm.
- [[Calculators/Lighting]] — translate PPFD targets into dimming percentages.
- [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]] — reference environmental targets while calculating offsets.
