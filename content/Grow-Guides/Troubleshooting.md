1. Confirm environment metrics (temps, RH, VPD, COâ‚‚) against room targets before adjusting nutrition.

1. Check plant age, pot weight, and runoff history to rule out overwatering or salt buildup.

1. Compare symptoms against the IPM and deficiency guides; photograph affected leaves for records.

1. Inspect root zone and stalk bases for pests, rot, or mechanical damage.

1. Document findings in the grow journal with timestamped photos and corrective actions taken.

1. Escalate to the cultivation lead or issue tracker if symptoms persist after two irrigation cycles.
