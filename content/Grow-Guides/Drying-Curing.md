# Drying and Curing Checklist

## Pre-Dry Prep

1. Clean the dry room, sanitize racks, and stage labeled totes for each cultivar.
2. Calibrate the hygrometer and dehumidifier controller to ensure readings are within ±1% RH.
3. Set environmental targets: 60–65 °F, 55–60% RH, and gentle, indirect airflow.

## Drying Steps

1. Hang whole plants or large branches in darkness with ample spacing to prevent touching.
2. Run oscillating fans on low pointed away from flowers; verify daily that small stems bend before they snap.
3. Log temperature and RH every morning and adjust dehumidification if the dry takes longer than 10 days.

## Curing Steps

1. Once outer buds feel dry and stems *almost* snap, trim and place flowers into clean jars or bins at 62% RH packs.
2. Burp containers twice daily for the first three days, then once daily until moisture stabilizes.
3. Record jar weights, aroma notes, and cure length in the harvest log; flag any jars showing off smells for QA review.
