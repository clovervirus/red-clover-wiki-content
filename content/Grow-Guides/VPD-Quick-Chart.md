- Propagation: 78°F with 75% RH hits ~0.8 kPa; mist domes only if VPD exceeds 0.9 and reset controllers to the Prop profile in [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]].
- Veg Early: Hold 80°F and 70% RH for ~1.0 kPa; use intake damper tweaks outlined in [[Env/Rooms/Flower]] to stabilize swings.
- Veg Late: 82°F at 65% RH targets 1.1 kPa; pair with 500 PPFD from [[Grow-Guides/Lighting-Quick-Targets]] to keep internodes tight.
- Flower Weeks 1–3: 82°F and 62% RH produce ~1.2 kPa; confirm with leaf temp offset readings logged in [[Data/Crop-Log]].
- Flower Weeks 4–6: 80°F and 58% RH deliver ~1.3 kPa; increase dehumidifier setpoints per the Week 4 automation card in [[SOP/Daily]].
- Flower Weeks 7–8: 78°F and 55% RH drive ~1.4 kPa; coordinate with the ripening nutrient taper in [[Feeding/Recipes]].
- Flush: 76°F and 52% RH reach ~1.5 kPa; monitor for terpene preservation cues noted in [[Grow-Guides/Flower]].
