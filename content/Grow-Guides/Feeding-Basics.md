# Feeding Basics

> Keep a **single source of truth** for the current recipe and log every change.

## Baseline Workflow

1. **Mix stock**: Label each stock with date, contents, and EC. Keep away from light/heat.
2. **Reservoir prep**: Start with RO/clean water. Add Crop Salt A→B per chart; then pH.
3. **Adjust**: Add RAW NPK powders to hit element targets (see notebook), dissolve fully.
4. **Record**: Log **EC/PPM in**, **pH in**, **EC/PPM out**, **pH out**, plant notes.

## Stage Targets (starting points)

- **Veg:** 1.3–1.8 mS/cm (650–900 ppm 500-scale)  
- **Flower:** 1.8–2.3 mS/cm (900–1150 ppm 500-scale)  
- **Runoff rule:** If **runoff EC** trends **up** → reduce feed or increase volume; trends **down** → increase feed or frequency.

## Safety / Compatibility

- Never mix concentrates together; always **pre-dilute**.
- Stagger silica and calcium additions to avoid precipitates.
- Keep notes of any reactions or clouding.
