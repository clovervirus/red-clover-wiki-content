- Prep water to 0.1–0.2 mS/cm EC following [[Feeding/Water-Source]] before any nutrients touch the reservoir.
- Pull the correct mother stock blends from [[Feeding/Recipes]] and dose in the order: calcium base, nitrogen stack, micros, then PK booster.
- Mix each addition for 2 minutes with circulation, rechecking EC and pH after every component; target 5.8–6.0 for veg and 6.1–6.3 for flower to align with [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]].
- Record batch ID, EC, pH, and temperature in [[Data/Crop-Log]]; flag deviations greater than ±0.2 mS/cm for lead grower review.
- Prime feed lines and confirm runoff EC in the active room matches feed strength within ±0.3 mS/cm per the watering checks in [[Grow-Guides/Veg]] and [[Grow-Guides/Flower]].
- Rinse measuring tools, secure concentrate lids, and initial the irrigation section of [[SOP/Daily]].
