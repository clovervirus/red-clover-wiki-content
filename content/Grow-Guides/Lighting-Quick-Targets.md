- Propagation: Hold fixtures at 24" to deliver ~250 PPFD; match dimmer values to the Prop scene in [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]] and rotate spares per [[Env/Lights/Fixture-Rotation]].
- Veg Early: Target 350 PPFD with an 18-hour day; verify average DLI of ~23 mol·m⁻²·d⁻¹ and log readings beside the weekly checklist in [[Grow-Journals]].
- Veg Late: Increase to 500 PPFD at 18" above canopy; balance with 1.1 kPa VPD from [[Env/Setpoints-by-Stage]] to prevent stretch.
- Flower Weeks 1–3: Ramp to 750 PPFD as plants transition; confirm uniformity with the quantum sensor workflow in [[SOP/Daily]].
- Flower Weeks 4–6: Push 850 PPFD while monitoring CO₂ targets; use [[Calculators/Lighting]] to fine-tune driver percentages before adjusting scenes.
- Flower Weeks 7–8: Maintain 900 PPFD on mature buds; back off if leaf temps climb 3°F above ambient and note any change in [[Data/Crop-Log]].
- Flush: Drop to 700 PPFD for ripening; align dimming with the flush environment recipe in [[Env/Rooms/Flower]].
