# Watering Cues

## Pot Weights (preferred)

- Weigh a **fully saturated** pot (after full runoff) and record.
- Water again when the pot is ~**40â€“50 % lighter** (adjust per cultivar and media).
- If dry time is <24 h early in veg, **up-pot** or reduce environmental demand.

## Plant Signals

- Leaves slightly soft near end of cycle = good.
- Droop, canoeing, or burnt tips = adjust feed or frequency and re-check VPD.
