- Lift-test target: irrigate when pots lose 55–60% of post-feed weight in veg and 50–55% in flower; document readings in the current [[Grow-Journals]].
- Visual check: slightly drooping petioles with leaves still angled upward indicate prime timing; severe flagging means you missed the window—log it in [[Data/Crop-Log]].
- Media probe: aim for 35–40% VWC before trigger in coco; sync probe alerts with the thresholds saved in the room controller under [[Env/Rooms/Flower]].
- Runoff goal: chase 10–15% runoff during veg to flush salts, then 15–20% in peak flower; compare EC to feed mix per [[Grow-Guides/Feeding-Basics]].
- Post-watering: confirm drainage trays are empty within 15 minutes; escalate to facilities if standing water persists per the maintenance note in [[SOP/Daily]].
