# Vegetative Stage Checklist

## Daily Actions

- Maintain VPD and temps in veg targets; confirm sensor alignment against the reference hygrometer.
- Train canopy: top, tuck, or tie-down once per week; note plant responses in the journal.
- Inspect runoff EC/PPM to confirm feed strength and compare to the Crop Salt chart.
- Scout leaf undersides with a 60Ã— loupe and remove any pest hot spots immediately.
- Verify irrigation emitters are clear and media is drying back within 24 hours.

## Weekly Actions

- Refresh notes in the current grow journal with plant height, node count, and training milestones.
- Clean and reset trellis or support stakes before the next growth spurt.
- Rotate plants a quarter turn to even canopy exposure and correct phototropism.
- Flush drip lines with RO water if salts are building on media surfaces.
