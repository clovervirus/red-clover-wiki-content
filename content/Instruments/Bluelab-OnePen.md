# Bluelab OnePen SOP

## Calibration Schedule

- **pH Calibration (Weekly):**

  - Rinse probe with RO water, blot dry, and calibrate with 7.0 solution followed by 4.0.

  - Record calibration date, time, and buffer lot numbers in the instrument log.

- **EC Calibration (Monthly):**

  - Use 2.77 EC standard at 77 Â°F, ensuring solution is within expiry.

  - If readings drift >0.2 EC, repeat and replace the probe cap solution.

## Daily Use

- Rinse the probe with RO water after every reservoir check and gently swirl before reading.

- Allow the probe to stabilize for 15 seconds before logging results.

- Avoid submerging past the immersion line; wipe housing dry prior to storage.

## Storage and Care

- Store the cap with fresh KCl reference solution to protect the probe tip.

- Replace storage solution weekly or whenever it appears cloudy.

- Keep the meter upright in the instrument rack; never store dry.
