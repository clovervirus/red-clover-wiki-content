**Batch Size:** 5 gallons concentrate stored in light-tight totes.

1. Stage equipment: food-grade tote, magnetic stirrer, PPE, and the calibrated [[Inventory/Bench-Scale]].
2. Fill tote with 4 gallons of 90 °F RO water and start circulation.
3. Add dry salts in this order, pausing for dissolution after each addition:

   - 4,800 g Calcium Nitrate
   - 3,200 g Magnesium Sulfate
   - 1,600 g Monopotassium Phosphate
   - 800 g Micronutrient blend

4. Top off to 5 gallons, verify EC between 22–24 mS/cm, and note the result in [[Data/Crop-Log]].
5. Label the tote with batch ID, date, and tech initials; store at 68–72 °F.
6. Dose concentrate at 240 mL per gallon of make-up water when preparing the main reservoir per [[Feeding/Water-Source]].
