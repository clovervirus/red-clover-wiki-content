1. Test incoming water for EC, pH, and temperature using the calibrated [[Instruments/Bluelab-OnePen]].

1. If EC is above 0.3 mS/cm, blend with RO to reach the target 0.1â€“0.2 mS/cm before nutrient additions.

1. Run the fill line for 60 seconds to purge standing water, then capture a 1-gallon sample and record results in [[Data/Crop-Log]].

1. Dose chlorine at 2 mL of 5% sodium hypochlorite per gallon when the incoming total chlorine is below 2 ppm; mix for 5 minutes with circulation pump.

1. Aerate the reservoir for 30 minutes before adding any [[Feeding/Recipes/Mother-Stock]] concentrates.

1. Cover the reservoir, label it with batch ID, and log completion in the daily [[SOP/Daily]] checklist.
