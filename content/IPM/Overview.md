# IPM Overview

## Program Pillars

- Keep a weekly scouting calendar and log observations with date, room, and pest pressure rating.

- Quarantine new genetics for 10 days; inspect under 60× magnification before integration.

- Rotate biologicals and contact sprays based on pest pressure, avoiding repeated use of the same mode of action.

- Sanitize work surfaces, shears, and transport carts with oxidizing cleaner at the start and end of every shift.

## Scouting Cadence

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Monday | Full canopy sweep with sticky card counts and foliar inspection. |
| Wednesday | Spot-check hotspots, flip or replace yellow cards, and update IPM log. |
| Friday | Soil-level inspection, check irrigation rooms, and prep next week's spray rotation. |

## Response Thresholds

- **Tier 1:** 1–2 pests per card – deploy beneficial insects and re-scout in 48 hours.

- **Tier 2:** 3–5 pests per card or visible foliar damage – apply preventative spray and increase environmental controls.

- **Tier 3:** >5 pests per card or systemic symptoms – execute containment SOP and notify management immediately.
