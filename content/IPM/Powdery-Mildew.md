# Powdery Mildew Response

## Containment Steps

1. Isolate affected plants and disable fans to prevent spread; bag and remove severely infected leaves.
2. Apply a registered fungicide or biological per label rates; rotate FRAC codes between treatments.
3. Sanitize grow space surfaces, trellis, and tools after treatment with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution.
4. Increase nighttime dehumidification to keep RH below 50% until symptoms abate.

## Follow-Up Monitoring

- Review environment logs for humidity spikes or airflow gaps and correct setpoints immediately.
- Reinspect treated plants 48 hours later; if powder returns, escalate to full-room fogger protocol.
- Replace or sterilize intake filters and confirm HEPA pre-filters are seated properly.
- Document all applications, lot numbers, and re-entry intervals in the IPM log.
