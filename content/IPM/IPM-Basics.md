# IPM Basics

## Prevention Routine

- Weekly scouting with a hand lens; record finds (thrips, mites, PM, etc.).

- Quarantine new genetics; sanitize tools between rooms.

- Rotate biologicals/contact sprays per pressure and label.

## Quick Response

1. **Isolate** affected plants; reduce air movement if spores/pests are airborne.

1. **Treat** with a labeled product (follow labels and local rules).

1. **Sanitize**: Benches, walls, filters, and tools.

1. **Review** logs: RH spikes, intake filters, and plant density.
