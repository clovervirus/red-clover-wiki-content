## Monitoring

- Place yellow sticky cards at media level in each room per [[IPM/Scouting-Routine]].

- Check media moisture; note over-saturation events in [[Data/Crop-Log]].

## Thresholds

- Action threshold: 20 adults per card per week or larvae presence in media cores.

## Treatment

1. Drench affected zones with *Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis* at label rate.

1. Apply beneficial nematodes (*Steinernema feltiae*) 48 hours later.

1. Increase dry-back period by 2 hours while maintaining plant health per [[Feeding/Water-Source]].

1. Replace top layer of media with sterile coco if larvae persist after 5 days.

1. Continue monitoring daily until counts drop below threshold for 10 consecutive days.
