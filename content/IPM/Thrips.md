## Identification

- Silvering on leaves, black speck frass, and scarring on young tissue.

- Confirm with 10x loupe; capture photos for [[Data/Crop-Log]].

## Thresholds

- **Veg:** 3 thrips per plant triggers soft release of beneficials.

- **Flower:** 1 thrip per plant triggers immediate [[IPM/First-Response]].

## Treatment Plan

1. Deploy *Amblyseius cucumeris* sachets at 1 per plant.

1. Release *Orius insidiosus* at 1 per sq ft for hotspots.

1. Apply Spinosad spray at lights-off, following label and re-entry interval.

1. Re-scout after 48 hours using [[IPM/Scouting-Routine]].

1. Continue weekly beneficial releases until counts remain below threshold for 14 days.
