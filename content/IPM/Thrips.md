## Identification
- Silvering on leaves, black speck frass, and scarring on young tissue.
- Confirm with 10x loupe; capture photos for [[Data/Crop-Log]].

## Thresholds
- **Veg:** 3 thrips per plant triggers soft release of beneficials.
- **Flower:** 1 thrip per plant triggers immediate [[IPM/First-Response]].

## Treatment Plan
1. Deploy *Amblyseius cucumeris* sachets at 1 per plant.
2. Release *Orius insidiosus* at 1 per sq ft for hotspots.
3. Apply Spinosad spray at lights-off, following label and re-entry interval.
4. Re-scout after 48 hours using [[IPM/Scouting-Routine]].
5. Continue weekly beneficial releases until counts remain below threshold for 14 days.
