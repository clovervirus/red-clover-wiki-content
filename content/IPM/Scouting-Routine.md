## Schedule

- Perform daily before lunch per [[SOP/Daily]].
- Rotate starting rooms so each zone opens the inspection once per week.

## Steps

1. Sanitize hands and tools; wear fresh gloves.
2. Inspect the underside of fan leaves on the first, middle, and last table in each row.
3. Check sticky cards and note pest counts in [[Data/Crop-Log]].
4. Capture macro photos of any suspect damage and upload to the IPM drive.
5. Flag anything above action thresholds listed in [[IPM/Thrips]] or [[IPM/Fungus-Gnats]].

## Reporting

- Add findings to the #ipm Slack channel with room, pest, severity, and actions taken.
- Escalate urgent issues immediately to the IPM Lead and start [[IPM/First-Response]].
